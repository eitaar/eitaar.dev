# GitHub Copilot Instruction

## Overview

This document outlines the rules and guidelines for using GitHub Copilot in this project. Please adhere to these instructions to ensure consistency and quality.

## Rules

### 1. Response Language

- Copilot's suggestions and explanations must always be in **Japanese**, regardless of the language used in the user's instructions. The only exception is when writing **commit messages**, which must be in **English**.

### 2. Code Comments

- Add comments only when the code involves **complex logic** or **challenging processing**.
- Write comments in **English**.
- Avoid adding comments to simple or self-explanatory code.

### 3. Git Commit Messages

- Commit messages must be written in **English**.
- Use the following prefixes to indicate the type of change:
  - `feat:` for new features.
  - `fix:` for bug fixes.
  - `docs:` for documentation updates.
  - `style:` for formatting changes (no code logic changes).
  - `refactor:` for code restructuring without altering functionality.
  - `test:` for adding or updating tests.
  - `chore:` for maintenance tasks.
  - `revert:` for reverting previous changes.
- Include a brief explanation of the reason for the change or what it addresses.
  - Examples:
    - `feat: Add user authentication feature to enhance security`
    - `feat: Update example.jsx to improve mobile user experience`
    - `fix: Correct typo in README for better clarity`

### 4. Coding Style

- Use **camelCase** for function and variable names.
- Use **PascalCase** for JavaScript/TypeScript classes, interfaces, types, namespaces, enums, and constants.
- Maintain consistent indentation and formatting as per the project's established style guide.

### 5. tech stacks

when suggesting code, consider the following tech stacks:

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- TypeScript
- Astro v5.x.x
- Tailwind CSS v4.x.x - **no more tailwind.config.js**
- Astro Icon (iconify) - only use mdi and devicon icons sets.

### 6. Quick Fix Mode (-qf)

When I add the -qf flag (short for quick fix) at the end of my instruction:
- Only fix exactly the issue I described.
- Do not make any other edits — no linting, formatting, or refactoring.
- Do not add comments unless the fix requires complex or non-obvious logic.
- Assume all other parts of the file are correct and complete.
- Only read and modify the specified file — ignore all others.

### 7. use context 7 and playwright mcp mode (-usemcp)

When I add the -usemcp flag (short for use context 7 and playwright mcp mode) at the end of my instruction:
- Use the context 7 mcp to get the lates documents.
- use playwright mcp to test the code.

### 8. environments
- the development server is always running on localhost:4321 so you do not need to start a new server.
